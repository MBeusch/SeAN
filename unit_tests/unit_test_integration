# Unit test for the numerical integration.
# The code will integrate over a single or a sum of 2D normal distributions with the expression
# gauss_2d(e, z) = c*exp(-(pow(e - e0, 2) + pow(z - z0, 2)/(2*pow(sigma, 2)))
# Where the result can be calculated analytically.
# Minimum and maximum of e and z for the integration (comma separated values)
-3., 3.
# Function to be integrated, constants c (string + comma separated values)
