# Unit test for the numerical integration.
# The code will integrate over a sum of 2D normal distributions with the expression:
# gauss_2d(x, y) = c*exp(-(pow(x - x0, 2) + pow(y - y0, 2)/(2*sigma*sigma)))
# Where the result can be calculated analytically
# Minimum and maximum of x and y for the integration
-3., 3.
# Function to be integrated
